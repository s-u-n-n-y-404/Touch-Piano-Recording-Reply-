# Project: Touch-Piano-Recording-Reply
Hello! everyone, this tutorial will be extremely exciting for electronics makers because we will be designing our own touch-capacitive Piano with Arduino Nano. We will include a recording and replay feature on our Piano. So far, we've made a few piano projects using Arduino, but this one is quite different because we are going to use capacitive touch keys for our piano keys. So along with learning how to build a fun to play piano we will also explore how to design capacitive touch keys on PCB, as you can we have tried to make our keys looks as close an actual piano key. The PCB looks and works like a piano, thanks to its fabricator PCBWay, we will also explore how we designed and fabricated this board but before that, let's explore capacitive touch sensors and how it works.

## How a Capacitive Touch Sensor Works?

We know that in order to form a capacitor with some capacitance value, we need two parallel conductive plates separated by a dielectric material. But how can we tell if the capacitance has changed simply by touching the conductive plate with our fingers? Our answer is based on our fundamental understanding of the capacitor. As we know, changing the area of the conductive plate or the distance between two parallel conductive plates can change the capacitance value. Between the conductive plate and the finger, we have air as a dielectric medium. As a result, when we touched the plate with our fingers, there was an uncertain increase in capacitance because our finger was acting as a conductive object and the distance between the two conductive objects was reduced. We know the basic formula of the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is,
